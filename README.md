This calculator web application comprises HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The HTML file sets up the basic structure with input elements for displaying calculations and buttons for numbers, operators, and actions like AC and DEL. CSS styles the calculator components, defining appearances such as colors, sizes, and shadows. JavaScript handles user interactions, updating the input field based on button clicks, evaluating mathematical expressions, and providing visual effects for button clicks. Together, these files create a visually appealing and fully functional calculator interface.
